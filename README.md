Driver for (some) Brother laser printers
========================================

Most Brother printers support a standard printer language such as PCL
or PostScript, but not all do.  If you have a monochrome Brother laser
printer (or multi-function device) and the other open source drivers
don't work, this one might help.

It is known to support these printers:

* Brother DCP-1510 series
* Brother DCP-7030
* Brother DCP-7055
* Brother DCP-7055W
* Brother DCP-7065DN
* Brother MFC-7360N

Build requirements
------------------
Besides a working build environment (i.e. `gcc` or compatible compiler) you will need the header files for libcupsimage2 (especially `raster.h`), as well as the corresponding general build files for CUPS. On Ubuntu and Debian, and their derivatives, these are contained in the following packages and their respective dependencies:

* `libcups2-dev`
* `libcupsimage2-dev`
