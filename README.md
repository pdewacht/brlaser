Driver for (some) Brother laster printers
=========================================

Most Brother printers support a standard printer language such as PCL
or PostScript, but not all do.  If you have a monochrome Brother laser
printer (or multi-function device) and the other open source drivers
don't work, this one might help.

It is known to support these printers:

* Brother DCP-1510 series
* Brother DCP-7030
* Brother DCP-7055
* Brother DCP-7065DN
