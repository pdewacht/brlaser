brlaser: Brother laser printer driver
=====================================

brlaser is a CUPS driver for Brother laser printers.

Although most Brother printers support a standard printer language
such as PCL or PostScript, not all do. If you have a monochrome
Brother laser printer (or multi-function device) and the other open
source drivers don't work, this one might help.

This driver has been reported to work with these printers:

Other printers
--------------

If your printer isn't included in the list above, just try selecting
any entry marked 'brlaser' and see if it works.

If it does, please create a new issue here in Github and include the
output of this command:

    sudo lpinfo --include-schemes usb -l -v

Then I'll be able to add a proper entry for your printer.


Installation
------------

Some operating systems already ship this driver. This is the case for
at least Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Raspbian, openSUSE, NixOS, Arch Linux 
and Guix.
Look for a package named `printer-driver-brlaser`.

You'll also need Ghostscript, in case that's not installed
automatically.

Once brlaser is installed, you can add your printer using the usual
CUPS interface.


Building from source
--------------------

To compile brlaser you'll need CMake and the CUPS development packages
(libcups2-dev, libcupsimage2-dev or similar).

Get the code by cloning the git repo <!-- or downloading the [latest
release] -->. Compile and install with these commands:

    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install

It might be needed to restart CUPS after this.
